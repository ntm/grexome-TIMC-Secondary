# Parses on stdin a Strelka/GATK/elPrep/deepVariant GVCF file with one or more
# sample data columns;
# Args: see $USAGE.
# Prints to stdout a VCF (default) or GVCF (with --keepHR) file where:
# - samples that don't appear in $samplesFile "sampleID" column are removed
#   (allows to discard data for samples that are in the GVCF but were
#   obsoleted as dupes);
# - ignore all samples except the $samplesOfInterest, if specified;
# - QUAL is cleared to '.';
# - INFO is cleared to '.' (except for non-variant blocks with --keepHR, where 
#      INFO is kept as-is since END= is required)
# - phased genotypes x|y are replaced by unphased x/y;
# - hemizygous calls x (strelka) or x/* or */x (gatk) are replaced by HV x/x;
# - the new and useless GATK "weAreInAHomoDel" calls */* are replaced by ./.;
# - the variant calls in data columns are replaced by ./. if a QC call-condition
#   is not met (see "heuristics"), or if previous call was '.' (the Strelka NOCALL);
# - without --keepHR, lines where every sample is now ./. or 0/0 are skipped;
# - with --keepHR, lines where every sample is now ./. are skipped;
# - the bogus read counts for the new '*' ALT used by GATK4 are substracted from DP and AD;
# - AF is moved (if it pre-exists) or added (otherwise) to FORMAT right after GT, 
#   and every 0/x or x/x call gets for AF the fraction of reads supporting the x ALT
#   (rounded to 2 decimals), HR and x/y calls get '.';
# - DP is moved (if it pre-exists) or added (otherwise, eg deepVariant non-variant blocks
#   and some strelka indels) to FORMAT right after AF, and set to sumOfADs if DP didn't exist
#   or was smaller than sumOfADs (ignoring the new GATK4 AD for the '*' ALT, as indicated above);
# - fix blatantly wrong genotype calls, see "heuristics" below;
# - ALTs that are not called in any sample (after fixing errors) are removed, and
#   DATA values are adjusted accordingly: GT is fixed (new ALT indexes), AD/ADF/ADR/VAF and
#   PL values for removed ALTs are discarded (but the corresponding reads are still
#   counted in DP, see sumOfADs above);
# - REF + remaining ALTs are normalized (but not left-aligned): 
#   * remove bases present at the end of REF and all ALTs;
#   * remove bases present at the start of REF and all ALTs, and increase POS accordingly
# - work around strelka "feature": indel positions can be preceded by an HR call
#   that includes the first base of the indel (HR call at $pos or non-variant block
#   with END=$pos followed by indel call at the same $pos), this bogus HR call is removed.
#
###########
# NOTES on normalization of variants:
# - this script does NOT left-align variants
# - it also doesn't try to merge lines with overlapping REFs or identical POS values,
#   even if this results from our renormalization (where POS can increase): if this
#   occurs it means the clash was already present, even if it wasn't explicit.
# Downstream tools need to be aware of this. 4_mergeGVCFs.pl is, and tries to do
# the right thing.
