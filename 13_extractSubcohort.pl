# Takes 1 argument: $subcohortFile, a text file with a list of samples
# of interest, one per line;
# read on stdin one of:
# - a cohort TSV as produced by extractCohorts.pl, probably filtered
#   and reordered, probably gone through addPatientIDs and requireUndiagnosed
#   (but NOT gzipped, just "gunzip -c |" if needed);
# - a transcript TSV as produced by extractTranscripts.pl, probably gone
#   through addPatientIDs.
# "Probably" here means that this script should work without, but I
# currently test and use it that way.
# We automatically detect whether stdin is a cohort or a transcript file.
# Print to stdout a sub-cohort file, identical to the infile except it
# only has the lines where one of the samples of the sub-cohort is:
# - Cohorts -> HV or HET (OTHERCAUSE is not enough)
# - Transcripts -> HV or BIALLELIC (including OTHERCAUSE)
